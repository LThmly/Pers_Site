    <h2>week_0 | 'why blog?' | 7/16/2025</h2>
    <p>Why blog?<br><br>I'm not a PhD researcher writing reports on groundbreaking technology or a senior developer with 20 plus years of experience. In fact, I'm quite the opposite. I'm an undergrad who still has so much to learn.
      <br><br>So why blog?
      <br><br>Becauseâ€¦ I still have so much to learn.
      <br><br>It's become far too easy to digest hours of lectures and read hundreds of pages of material and feel like you've become an expert, all while being unable to recall a single idea from what you've just consumed. That's why I'm creating this blog. It gives me an outlet to share what I've learned and really dig into the details of each and every topic.
      <br><br>I hope to look back on my early posts hundreds of days from now and learn from my past self. I aim to share not just what I learned, but how I learned it. Maybe the process was good, maybe it wasn't. Maybe I need to take a new approach, maybe I don't. Either way, I want to share the realities of learning. I'm not an expert now and I won't be an expert in a week.
      <br><br>To anyone reading this, whether you're another student or just curious, I hope this blog can help you in some way too. Maybe you'll learn what not to do from hours of my mistakes. Maybe you'll find a concept explained in a specific way that finally makes sense. Maybe you'll relate to the ups and downs of trying to figure something out. Or maybe, it will just remind you that it is okay to not have all the answers right away.
      <br><br>So I guess it's time to start :D
